# Euler Labels

This repository contains a database of metadata about [Euler Vault Kit](https://docs.euler.finance/euler-vault-kit-white-paper/) vaults and related entities. This metadata is used to augment the [Euler dApp](https://app.euler.finance) UI by showing human-readable identifiers alongside vaults, and providing the information necessary to render custom pages for governors and packaged lending products.

If you have created a vault and wish to have it included in this database, please read the rest of this file, fork the repo, and create a pull request.

## Schema

Each network has a directory, named after its numeric `chainId`. For example, the Ethereum mainnet data is stored in directory `1/`.

Inside each network's directory are JSON files that correspond to the following schemas. All keys are optional unless indicated as required.

### `entities.json`

Each entry in this object corresponds to a company, organisation, or other entity. Each key is an **entity ID**, which is a unique string per entity. It should be in "URL slug" format (lowercase ASCII letters or numbers, separated by `-` characters).

* `name`: Full, official name of the entity. (Required)
* `logo`: The filename of a logo stored in the `logo/` directory.
* `description`: Long-form description of the entity, displayed on the entity's page.
* `url`: Website where users can learn more about the entity.
* `addresses`: An object that indicates addresses controlled by this entity. Each key is a checksumed hex address, and each value is a human-meaningful description of what this address represents.
* `social`: An object that indicates social media handles controlled by this entity. Each key is a name of a social media system, and each value is the entity-specific username/handle.

### `vaults.json`

Each entry in this object represents a vault. Each key is the 20-byte ethereum address, in checksumed hex format. Each vault has the following keys:

* `name`: Name of the vault for display purposes, for example in table views. Maximum 40 characters. (Required)
* `description`: Long-form description of the vault displayed on the vault's dedicated page.
* `entity`: An entity ID that refers to the organisation responsible for governing and/or creating this vault, or a list of entity IDs if the vault is joint-managed.

### `products.json`

Each entry in this object corresponds to a lending product, which is primarily a grouping of vaults under a particular branding umbrella. Each key is the **product ID**, which is a unique string per product. It should be in "URL slug" format (lowercase ASCII letters or numbers, separated by `-` characters).

* `name`: Official name of the product. (Required)
* `description`: Long-form description of the product, displayed on the product's page.
* `entity`: An entity ID that refers to the organisation responsible for governing and/or creating this vault, or a list of entity IDs if the vault is joint-managed.
* `url`: Website where users can learn more about the product.
* `logo`: The filename of a logo stored in the `logo/` directory.
* `vaults`: An array of the vault addresses (in checksumed hex format) that comprise the product. Each vault must exist in the `vaults.json` file.

### `points.json`

Each entry in this array corresponds to points available on deposits in a vault. Either `collateralVaults` or `liabilityVaults` or both are required. Each item has the following

* `token`: The token address (in a checksumed hex format) that the points are denominated in.
* `name`: The name of the points, for example "Euler Points". (Required)
* `description`: A long-form description of the points, displayed within points tooltips.
* `skipTooltipPrefix`: If true, the tooltip text will not be prefixed with "Deposits earns {logo}".
* `url`: A URL where users can learn more about the points.
* `logo`: The filename of a logo stored in the `logo/` directory. (Required)
* `collateralVaults`: An array of the vault addresses (in checksumed hex format) that offer these points. Each vault does not need to exist in the `vaults.json` file.
* `liabilityVaults`: An array of the vault addresses (in checksumed hex format) that offer these points. Each vault does not need to exist in the `vaults.json` file.
* `entity`: An entity ID that refers to the organisation responsible for governing and/or creating this vault, or a list of entity IDs if the vault is joint-managed.

### `earnProducts.json`

Each entry in this object corresponds to earn-specific lending products. The schema is similar to `products.json` but specifically for earn-focused products. Each key is the **product ID** in "URL slug" format. Product IDs must be unique within `earnProducts.json` but can overlap with IDs in `products.json`.

* `name`: Official name of the earn product. (Required)
* `description`: Long-form description of the earn product.
* `entity`: An entity ID or list of entity IDs for the organization(s) responsible for the product.
* `url`: Website for more information about the earn product.
* `vaults`: An array of vault addresses (in checksumed hex format) that comprise the earn product.

### `opportunities.json`

Each entry in this object represents opportunities associated with specific vaults.

* `{opportunityType}`: An object representing a specific opportunity type (e.g., "cozy"). Each opportunity type can contain:
  * `safetyModule`: The address of the safety module associated with this opportunity, in checksumed hex format.

## Logos

Logos exist in the `logo/` directory, and should satisfy the following properties:

* SVG/PNG (preferred) or JPG format
* Square-shaped

## Scripts

The repository includes several npm scripts to help maintain the data:

* `npm run verify`: Validates all JSON files against their schemas and ensures all Ethereum addresses are properly checksummed.
* `npm run fix`: Normalizes all Ethereum addresses to their proper checksummed format and fixes Biome formatting issues (like trailing commas) across all chain files.

## Verification

Before making your pull request, please ensure that `verify.js` succeeds:

    apt install -y npm jq
    npm i
    node verify.js
